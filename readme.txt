hello, thanks for choosing the wp age verification plugin

activate the plugin

go to admin panel and go to Settings > WP age verification and set up your necessities.
Of course you have to make a post or page to review the css fields you change.

use the shortcode '[wpage]' in any post or page, you would like to protect it from people below a certain year.

if a post have the shortcode '[wpage]' there will be an input form replacing the post or page content. once a visitor inputs
 his or her birthdate and press enter, the visitor can see the contents if he is above the certain years old, else a message shows instead of the contents
"Sorry, You are not eligible to see the content". A cookie will be set for tracing the visitors for 30 days.

If there is any bug, don't hesitate to ask me
you can find me in skype  sohag_skype

thanks
